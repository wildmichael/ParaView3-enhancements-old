** Revision 1.1  2008-11-07 16:41:14  jeff
** ENH: Adding a 2D geoview. Adding the geographic projection library libproj4
** to Utilities. Updating the architecture of the geospatial views. All
** multi-resolution sources are now subclasses of vtkGeoSource. Each source
** has its own worker thread for fetching refined images or geometry.
** On the 3D side, vtkGeoGlobeSource is an appropriate source for vtkGeoTerrain,
** and vtkGeoAlignedImageSource is an appropriate source for
** vtkGeoAlignedImageRepresentation. On the 2D side, vtkGeoProjectionSource is an
** appropriate source for vtkGeoTerrain2D, and the image source is the same.
